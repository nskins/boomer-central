      p Welcome to Boomer's webpage. Boomer is a middle-aged beagle-basset mix with a big heart. He enjoys running around the yard, playing games, and snuggling up in his red blanket.
      p Boomer loves food! Some of his favorite delicacies are bacon, pizza, and chicken; however, he will consume #[em almost] anything. When someone drops food, Boomer quickly devours the mess like a sentient vaccuum cleaner.
      p Thank you for visiting Boomer's webpage! Here you will find pictures, news, stories, and all things considering the world's most loveable hound!
