# Boomer Central

Web app for our favorite doggo.

## Setup

You should have a MongoDB database with collections matching those specified in the models directory. See the connection URI at db.js for naming conventions. I am considering how to automate this step.

Then enter these commands to run the app:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
